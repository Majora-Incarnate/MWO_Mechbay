# MWO Mechbay
Offline resource for MWO developed to allow customization of Mechs within MWO.

# Roadmap
1. Continue reworking backend classes to be more flexible and readable in json.
2. (Minimum Viable Product) Get Mechlab module working with at least previous functionality.
3. Get Creator module with mech oriented workflows (so no equipment creation).
4. Get Encyclopedia module with all planned pages and data structures necessary for pages.
5. Transition from java to another languange and GUI framework.
  * Begin transition to Qt using java wrappers initially and then moving to C++.
  * -OR-
  * Begin transitioning to Rust using [sciter](https://github.com/pravic/rust-sciter) as a GUI framework.
6. Get Parser module to be able to parse and write out data from gamefiles.
7. Add missing workflows for custom equipment to Creator module.

# Features To Add/Nice to Haves
* Drag-n-Drop - Something I never bothered with before, I consider this part of the MVP despite it not being an original feature just because it is nice and I want to move away from the item queue layout I had before.
* Dynamic Structure/Armor - As apart of Drag-n-Drop, I need to support dynamic slots for things like endo and ferro.
* Warnings/Suggestions - This is more to help people make good build decisions, whether it be something like the fact the build can break ghost heat or whether you have a dead arm that could be stripped of armor.
* Importing Pretty Print - One nice to have feature would be the ability to import using a pretty print version of a variant.
* Niftier GUI - This could probably be achieved by looking up some 3rd party JComponents, but having support to better show motion range better for example would be nice to keep in line with Smurfy and Li-Song.
